<p>  Major League Baseball (MLB) introduced significant rule changes before the 2023 season to improve the pace of play, action and safety. These changes followed trends that MLB viewed as harmful to the game for players and fans. The priority for the fans was reducing the duration of each game. 
 </p>

<p> The end of the 2022 season marked 11 consecutive seasons with an average game time of at least three hours. MLB introduced a pitch timer to shorten at-bats and speed up the pace. They implemented a 30-second timer between batters, a 20-second timer between pitches when runners are on bases and a 15-second timer when the bases are empty. If the pitcher does not start their throwing motion by the end of the timer, the batter is awarded an automatic ball, shifting the count in their favor. In addition, if a batter is not <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-2023-rule-changes-pitch-timer-larger-bases-shifts" target="blank">“in the box and alert to the pitcher”</a> when the timer reaches 8 seconds, the pitcher is awarded an automatic strike.
 </p>

<p> Along with the pitch timer, the league also limited the number of times a pitcher could make a pickoff attempt to two per at-bat. If the pitcher attempts a third pickoff and is unsuccessful, the runner will be awarded the next base. This change was made to encourage more stolen base attempts.
 </p>

<p> For the players, the league wanted to shift the balance toward offense, as data had indicated they were operating at a disadvantage. MLB decided to eliminate the “shift,” a defensive strategy that would cause teams to align their infields or outfields differently depending on the hitter’s tendencies. For example, if a left-handed batter is a “pull” hitter, it is almost always to the right side of the field when they put the ball in play. Defenses would often move their third basemen into the right side of the field. Eliminating the shift meant defenses could no longer have more than two infielders on either side of 2nd base. They also made it illegal for fielders to line up in the outfield grass.
 </p>

<p> Another change was increasing the size of the bases to prioritize player safety while making it slightly easier to steal bases. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd bases increased from 15 inches square to 18 inches, giving the baserunners more room on the bases to reach when sliding into the bags. Home plate was unchanged.</p>

<p> With two full seasons and about six weeks into the third since the changes, let's examine how these rule changes have impacted Major League Baseball. </p>

      <p> The pacing changes led to immediate results, with the average game duration falling from 186 minutes in 2022 to 162 minutes in 2023, the lowest average since 1984. </p>
      <p> The changes and their success mark the realization of Commissioner Rob Manfred's goal to shorten games, which he revealed in 2017. An article from Reuters said he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/sports/baseball-commissioner-wants-faster-major-league-games-but-rejects-ties-idUSKBN16E155/" target="_blank">“wants to add a pitch clock and limit tactical discussions on the mound to speed up play.”</a> Six years later, Manfred got his wish, and it improved the pace of play. </p>
      <p> Manfred was concerned about the length of games being a deterrent for the younger generation. Speeding up the game and shifting the balance toward the hitters by eliminating the shift and base size changes were part of his efforts to keep the game fresh and attractive for younger viewers. </p>
      <p> Attendance rose significantly from <a href="https://apnews.com/sports/baseball-638e10b85a15366a7c6ffa5e7f21d6b3" target="blank">64 million in 2022 to 70 million in 2023.</a> On average, more than 3,000 fans attended games in 2023 than in 2022. Plenty of that increase can be attributed to the rule changes that have improved the gameday experience for fans. </p>
      <p> The average game duration fell from 162 minutes in 2023 to 158 minutes in 2024. Through the first six weeks of the 2025 season, that number increased to 159 minutes and appears to have settled. Attendance increased from 70 million in 2023 to 71 million in 2024. Manfred’s changes seem to have been received well by the fans. </p>

      <p> Stolen base attempts surged immediately in 2023, increasing by 0.22 from 0.68 attempts per game to 0.9 attempts per game. </p>
      <p> The highest average stolen base attempts total of the 21st century came in 2011, when there were 0.93 attempts per game. That number steadily decreased until 2021, when the average plateaued at 0.61 attempts. While some of the increase can be attributed to the increased base sizes, most of it came from limited pickoff attempts. </p>
      <p> The increases continued in 2024, rising to 0.94 attempts per game, a record for this century. More movement on the basepaths makes the game more exciting and draws more attention to every pitch. Baserunners pose a significant threat now that they are 50% more likely to run than four years ago. </p>
      <p> Although the 2025 numbers have a small sample size of just six weeks, they are surging even higher, reaching an average of 1.03 attempts per game. The current average of 0.81 steals is only the second time in the last 100 years that the average has eclipsed 0.80 per game. While the 2023 and 2024 numbers did not signal a return to the record-setting steal numbers recorded in 1987, 2025 has started with a record-setting pace. </p>
      <p> Manfred’s vision, which started with limiting tactical discussions on the mound and evolved into limiting pickoffs, has positively impacted the game. </p>

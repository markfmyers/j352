  <h2>College and Early NBA Career</h2>

  <p id="Para2"> Rondo attended the University of Kentucky for 2 years, during which he led the SEC in assists in 2005-06 and steals in 2004-05. After his sophomore season, he declared for the NBA Draft.</p>

  <p id="Para3"> Rondo was selected 21st overall in the 2006 NBA Draft by the Phoenix Suns and immediately traded to the Boston Celtics. He spent 8.5 seasons in Boston, during which he earned four All-Star selections and won the NBA Finals in 2008. Rondo led the league in assists twice (2011-12 and 2012-13) and steals in 2009-10. He will be remembered most for his time in Boston, helping deliver the franchise its 17th NBA Championship.  </p>

  <h3>Departure from Boston and Becoming a Journeyman</h3>

  <p id="Para4"> During the 2014-2015 season, Rondo was traded from the Boston Celtics to the Dallas Mavericks. Due to injury issues and not connecting with coach Rick Carlisle, Rondo's tenure in Dallas was short, playing just 48 games. </p>

  <p id="Para5"> Rondo signed a one-year deal with the Sacramento Kings during free agency in 2015. He enjoyed a return to his Boston form, leading the league in assists. </p>

  <p id="Para6"> Rondo signed a two-year deal with the Chicago Bulls during free agency in 2016. Alongside Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade, Rondo and the #8 seed Bulls took a surprising 2-0 lead over the #1 seed Celtics in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals until a fractured right thumb ended his season. The Bulls lost the next four games and were eliminated. Rondo was waived by the Chicago Bulls following the 2016-17 season. </p>

  <p id="Para7"> Rondo signed a one-year deal with the New Orleans Pelicans. He excelled with the big-man duo of Anthony Davis and Demarcus Cousins. Rondo averaged 13.4 assists in a Western Conference Quarterfinals sweep of the Portland Trailblazers. The Pelicans were defeated by the eventual champions: Golden State. </p>

  <p id="Para8"> Rondo signed a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Lakers during free agency in 2018. His role changed, and he was no longer the starting point guard, instead being the leader of the bench unit and a mentor for young guard Lonzo Ball. Rondo re-signed with the Lakers in free agency in 2019, this time a two-year deal including a player option for the 2020-21 season. Rondo provided valuable minutes as the team's backup point guard, and excelled off the bench as the team won the 2020 NBA Finals. As a result of his playoff success, Rondo declined his player option for the 2020-21 season and became a free agent again. </p>

  <p id="Para9"> Rondo signed a two-year deal with the Atlanta Hawks in 2020. Injuries and a diminished role cut his time with the Hawks short, being traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in March 2021. </p>

  <p id="Para10"> Rondo provided a veteran presence and championship experience for a Clippers team that made it to the Western Conference Finals. He played a minor role for the team and was traded in the following offseason to Memphis. The Grizzlies bought out his contract and Rondo became a free agent. </p>

  <p id="Para11"> Rondo signed a one-year deal to return to the Los Angeles Lakers during free agency in 2021. His return did not go as planned and he was again traded mid-season, this time to the Cleveland Cavaliers. </p>

  <p id="Para12"> Rondo had a slightly increased role in Cleveland, but the team did not make the postseason. His contract expired and he never played for another team. Rondo retired in 2024. </p>

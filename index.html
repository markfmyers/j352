  <h1>Welcome to my Rajon Rondo page!</h1>

  <p>Rajon Pierre Rondo is an American former professional basketball player. A point guard, Rondo played two years of college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats before being drafted 21st overall by the Phoenix Suns in the 2006 NBA draft and subsequently traded to the Boston Celtics in a draft-day trade. He is one of the most underrated point guards in NBA history.</p>

  <p> Rondo spent the first seven seasons of his career in Boston, during which he earned four All-Star selections and won the NBA Finals in 2008. He was traded during his eighth season from the Boston Celtics to the Dallas Mavericks, as the Celtics were entering a full rebuild. After being traded to Dallas, Rondo became a journeyman, playing for eight different teams in his final eight seasons. He won his second NBA Finals in 2020 with the Los Angeles Lakers. </p>
